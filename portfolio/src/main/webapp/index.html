            <p>My name is Kristen Mason, and I'm a rising junior at Scripps College in Los Angeles, where I study
                computer science.
                I've been working from home in Saint Louis, Missouri, where I spend my free time baking,
                reading the "newest" Game of Thrones novel, watching Youtube videos, binging more Netflix
                shows than I'd ever care to admit, and playing with my puppy, Fitz.

                    <p>This is Fitz. His favorite pastime is pretending that he can't jump onto my bed in order
                        to trick me into giving him a boost to get up. Don't let the eyes fool you, he is perfectly
                        capable of getting up on his own. His second favorite passtime is barking during GVCs.</p>

            <h3>Here are some of my favorite places I've visited in the past few years! </h3>
            <div id="australia">
                <h4>Australia</h4>
                <p>This past winter, my family went to Australia for New Years. We visited Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne,
                    and Hamilton Island.
                    My favorite experiences from this trip were the fireworks on New Year's Eve in Sydney Harbour, and
                    going scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef!
                    Such a cool thing to check off the bucketlist! We actually visited during the awful fires they had
                    at the
                    beginning of the year. You can see in the picture of the Opera House that everything is smoky and
                    muted.
                    During our stay in Adelaide I actually woke up one morning to the smell of burning rubber because
                    the fires were so close!
                </p>

            </div>
            <div id="national-parks">
                <h4>National Parks</h4>
                <p>Since coming to college, I've visited 11 National Parks! Rocky Mountain National Park, Canyonlands,
                    Arches, Capitol Reef, Zion, Bryce Canyon,
                    Joshua Tree, Pinnacles, Channel Islands, Death Valley, and Petrified Forest NP, respectively. Here
                    are some of my favorite pictures from my favorite parks!
                    I'm a little spoiled because Joshua Tree NP is an hour drive away from my college, so my friends and
                    I will take short
                    day trips over there all the time!
                </p>

            <div id="cali">
                <h4>California</h4>
                <p>One of the best things about going to school in California is that every day can be a vacation! The
                    area around my school is so beautiful that it basically counts as
                    taking a fancy trip, so I've included some of my favorite pictures from California here.
