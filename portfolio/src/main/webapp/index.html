            <p> I'm a rising junior at Scripps College in Los Angeles, where I study computer science.
                I've been working from home in Saint Louis, Missouri, where I spend my free time baking,
                reading the "newest" Game of Thrones novel, watching Youtube videos, binging more Netflix
                shows than I'd ever care to admit, and playing with my puppy, Fitz.

            <p>This is Fitz. His favorite passtime is pretending that he can't jump onto my bed in order
                to trick me into giving him a boost to get up. Don't let the eyes fool you, he is perfectly
                capable of getting up on his own. His second favorite passtime is barking during GVCs.</p>
