            <p>My name is Kristen Mason, and I'm a rising junior at Scripps College in Los Angeles, where I study
                computer science.
                I've been working from home in Saint Louis, Missouri, where I spend my free time baking,
                reading the "newest" Game of Thrones novel, watching Youtube videos, binging more Netflix
                shows than I'd ever care to admit, and playing with my puppy, Fitz.

            <h2>Experience:</h2>
            <p>Here is a brief snapshot of my work and extracurricular experiences over the years, in a less formal setting than a traditional resume.</p>
            <div class="resume-item">
                <h3>Grader/Tutor for Introduction to Computer Science</h3>
                <p>Hands down my favorite on-campus job! I get to tutor students taking Harvey Mudd College's introductory CS course, CS5, and
                    get to help grade their exams and homework. We're called "grutors", short for Grader/Tutor, not group tutor like I originally thought.
                    In the fall, over 300 students are enrolled in CS5, and every Thursday, Professor Dodds will host grading dinners in an auditorium. The CS department
                    buys dinner for all of the grutors so we can grade while eating and listening to music. My favorite dinner is Chinese food from Star Wok, and 
                    since I sit at the front of the auditorium, I love to try and talk Prof. Dodds into playing weird music (my go-tos genres are Christmas and Disney.)
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="resume-item">
                <h3>Lifeguard at the Scripps Pool</h3>
                <p>Even though I won't be getting recertified for this job in the fall, I had a lot of fun working as a lifeguard. I mean, just check out
                    the pool!
                    <img class="travel-pic" src="/images/scPool.jpg" alt="The Scripps pool">
                    Who wouldn't love working at such a beautiful place? I actually took that picture
                    while on one of my shifts (but don't tell my manager that!) As a rule, lifeguards can only be on duty for 15 minutes
                    at at time, so half of my shift would be dedicated to homework time! This was especially nice during colder months, when 
                    no patrons would show up during my shift, so myself and the other guard on duty could watch Netflix together!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="resume-item">
                <h3>Summer Intern at The Intelligence Factory</h3>
                <p>I spent the summer working at this small startup with one of my friends from high school. I was in charge of managing the company's
                    Wordpress site. It was a lot of fun until one day the site went down during server maintenance <i>right</i> when I clicked publish changes,
                    and I spent 20 minutes convinced that I'd accidentally deleted the company's website off of the internet! Other than that, I worked a lot with Google Analytics to
                    get insight's into the company's SEO and take steps to improve it.
                </p>

            <div class="resume-item">
                <h3>Research Intern at WashU</h3>
                <p>Working at WashU was a blast. I spent two summers working at their NASA's Planetary Data Science Geosciences node in the remote sensing lab,
                    after spending my senior service project volunteering there. Some of the coolest things I got to do while working there were to sit in on a meeting between JPL and Johns
                    Hopkins University as they planned out specifics for the Dragonfly Mission to Titan in 2026(!), wear a VR headset that allowed me to walk around on the surface 
                    of Mars, work with data that came directely from both the Curiousity Rover and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, watch my coworker defend her dissertation and receive her doctorate, 
                    and run data processing directley through NASA's supercomputer, Pleiades.

                <h3>Extracurriculars</h3>
                <p>On campus, I'm the treasurer for my school's women in computer science club, the Scripps Code. I'm the floor captain and outside hitter for the Claremont College's women club volleyball team,
                    and last year we ranked 3rd in the SCCVBL, the only D3 school to make it that far. Our school's hackathon was cancelled this year, but my freshman year my team won 1st place in our division, and
                    now we participate in human centered design competitions such as the Sparkathon or IdeaJam hosted by Intuit.

            <p>Here are some fun facts about me!</p>

                    <p>This is Fitz. His favorite pastime is pretending that he can't jump onto my bed in order
                        to trick me into giving him a boost to get up. Don't let the eyes fool you, he is perfectly
                        capable of getting up on his own. His second favorite passtime is barking during GVCs.</p>

                <li>My favorite TV show right now is probably Brooklyn 99</li>

            <p>In order to beat the quarantine blues, I've picked up a number of hobbies, including (but not limited
                to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Baking sourdough bread (sometimes I trade my friend a loaf in exchange for eggs from her farm! Click on the picture to see my recipe)</li>

                <li>Listening to different kinds of music</li>

            <div id="australia">
                <h4>Australia</h4>
                <p>This past winter, my family went to Australia for New Years. We visited Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne,
                    and Hamilton Island.
                    My favorite experiences from this trip were the fireworks on New Year's Eve in Sydney Harbour, and
                    going scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef!
                    Such a cool thing to check off the bucketlist! We actually visited during the awful fires they had
                    at the
                    beginning of the year. You can see in the picture of the Opera House that everything is smoky and
                    muted.
                    During our stay in Adelaide I actually woke up one morning to the smell of burning rubber because
                    the fires were so close!

                <h4>National Parks</h4>
                <p>Since coming to college, I've visited 11 National Parks! Rocky Mountain National Park, Canyonlands,
                    Arches, Capitol Reef, Zion, Bryce Canyon,
                    Joshua Tree, Pinnacles, Channel Islands, Death Valley, and Petrified Forest NP, respectively. Here
                    are some of my favorite pictures from my favorite parks!
                    I'm a little spoiled because Joshua Tree NP is an hour drive away from my college, so my friends and
                    I will take short
                    day trips over there all the time!
